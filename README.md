# MJO_DeepLearning
Repository for Toms et al. (2019) publication on deep learning + the MJO

The code structure for this repository is fairly simple.

First, the script trainer_MJO_cnn.py is invoked, through which the mjo_CNN.py and MJOData.py scripts are invoked.

The trainer_MJO_cnn.py contains the steps to train and validate the CNN architecture that is
defined within mjo_CNN.py

MJOData.py is only used to load the data from the files (all of which are not included, since the files total
300 gigabytes in size).

If you would like to discuss the data used to train the model or gain access to demo files, please contact me directly at ben.toms@colostate.edu.

Thank you for your interest...

-Ben Toms
